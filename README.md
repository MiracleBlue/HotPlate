Hello!  Welcome to my silly little project for my own personal uses.  I made this project so I could teach myself angular.  It's just a simple music player.

If you arrived here by accident, you probably shouldn't try using anything in here unless you want a noob's example of angular code.

If you are supposed to be here, here's how to set up and run this project.

Clone the repository, and then in the root directory run npm install, and then bower install.  Then do node app.js and check out localhost:3000!  Yay music!
